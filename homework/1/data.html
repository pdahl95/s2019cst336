               <b>What is a Data Structure?</b> <br> 
                Simply put, a data structure is a container that stores data in a specific layout. 
                This <i>layout</i> allows a data structure to be efficient in some operations and inefficient in others. 
                Your goal is to understand data structures so that you can pick the data structure that's 
                most optimal for the problem at hand. <br> <br>

                <b>Why do we need Data Structures?</b><br>
                As data structures are used to store data in an organized form, and since data is the most 
                entity in computer science, the true worth of data structures is clear. <br> <br>

            <div class="right">
                <h3>Array</h3>
                <p> Array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.</p>

            <div class="right">
                <h3>Stack</h3>
                <p> A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: <br>
                push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.</p>

         <div class="btn btn-primary tooltip"> Linked Lists
            <div class="right">
                <h3>Linked Lists</h3>
                <p> A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. <br>
                There are a couple of different linked list, most common is Singly and Doubly Linked List!</p>

            <div class="right">
                <h3>Trees</h3>
                <p> Unlike Array and Linked List, which are linear data structures, tree is hierarchical (or non-linear) data structure. </p>

                <h3>Graphs</h3>
                <p> A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. <br> 
                The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.  </p>

                <h3>Hash Tables</h3>
                <p> Hashing is an important Data Structure which is designed to use a special function called the Hash function<br>
                which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements.  </p>

                <h3> Binary Search Tree </h3>
                <p>  Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:<br>
                - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.<br>
                - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.<br>
                - The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. </p>
