                <h5> Here you will be able to get a little overview of the related topics. For more information regarding Algorithm click the <i>'read more'</i> section below.
                <br><br> Throughout this website, you will be able to read about algorithms and data structures. You will also be able to try and solve very well known problems using some of what you have learned here!</h5>
                <p>
                    What exaclty is an algorithm and why would you care? <br>
                    That might be a very good question, and I hope I will be able to give you a good answer. <br><br>
                    One definition often used to define <b>Algorithms</b> is: <i> a set of steps to accomplish a task </i> <br><br>
                    For example: You are going to make a grilled cheese sandwich. To do so, you need to complete a couple of different steps: <br>
                    Step 1: Acquire bread <br>
                    Step 2: Apply cheese <br>
                    Step 3: Grill! <br>
                    Step 4: Enjoy! <br> <br>
                    
                    The same logic is used with computer algorithms. <br>
                    A <b>Computer Algorithm</b> is a <i>set of steps for a computer program to accomplish a task.</i> <br>
