                    "The formulation of the problem is often more essential than its solution, <br>
                    which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill." <br>

                <h2> Algorithms </h2>

                <p class="algotext">
                   To make a computer do anything, you have to write a computer program. To write a computer program,
                   you have to tell the computer, step by step, exactly what you want it to do. The computer then "executes" 
                   the program, following each step mechanically, to accomplish the end goal.<br>
                   When you are telling the computer what to do, you also get to choose how it's going to do it. <br>
                   That's where computer algorithms come in. The algorithm is the basic technique used to get the job done.<br>
                   Let's follow an example to help get an understanding of the algorithm concept.
                   
                  
                   
                   <p>
                       An algorithm is a defined computational procedure that takes some values, or a set of values, often known as <br>
                       <i>input</i> and  produces some value, or a set of values as <i> output. </i> <br><br> 
                        <img src="/cst336/homework/1/img/pivot.png" class="pivot"></img>
                       Example: <u> One might need to sort a sequence of numbers into non-decreasing order.</u> <br>
                       
                       - This problem is highly demand and is done very often, and because of that there exists know and pre-coded algorithms <br>
                       to do excatly what you need. The recepice is already there, therefore is no need to figure out a new algorithm for something <br>
                       that already exists. <br>
                     
                       Various algorithms might be Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Bin Sort, etc. <br>
                       What is needed on the other hand, is to know each algorithm to be able to know exactly when to use which.
                       <br> <br>
                       
                       For example, if you have a million integer values between 1 and 10 and you need to sort them, the Bin Sort <br>
                       is the correct algorithm to use. If you have a million books titles, then quick sort might be a better option. <br>
                       The important aspect here is to know the strenghts and weaknesses of the different algorithms!
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       Know you might be wondering.. If that is algorithm, then what is data structures..? <br>
                       If you are, that is very nice, because I am about to tell you the difference between the two right now. <br><br>
                       
                       "DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DATA STRUCTURE AND AN ALGORITHM: A data structure is the way you define a certain object <br>
                       in a program language. ... An algorithm is a specific way of programming a task to make it work on the data you have".<br>
