                    To make a computer do anything, you have to write a computer <br> program. To write a computer program, you have to tell<br> the computer, step by step, exactly what you want it to do. <br>The computer then "executes" the program,
                    following each step mechanically, to accomplish the end goal.<br> When you are telling the computer what to do, you also get to choose how it's going to do it. <br> That's where computer algorithms come in. The algorithm is the basic
                    technique used to get the job done.<br> Let's follow an example to help get an understanding of the algorithm concept.
                    <p>
                        An algorithm is a defined computational procedure that takes some values, or a set of values, often known as <br>
                        <i>input</i> and produces some value, or a set of values as <i> output. </i> <br><br>
                        <img src="img/pivot.png" alt="" class="pivot"> Example: <u> One might need to sort a sequence of numbers into non-decreasing order.</u> <br> - This problem is highly demand and is done very often, and because
                        of that there exists know and pre-coded algorithms <br> to do excatly what you need. The recepice is already there, therefore is no need to figure out a new algorithm for something <br> that already exists. <br> Various algorithms
                        might be Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Bin Sort, etc. <br> What is needed on the other hand, is to know each algorithm to be able to know exactly when to use which.
                        <br> <br> For example, if you have a million integer values between 1 and 10 and you need to sort them, the Bin Sort <br> is the correct algorithm to use. If you have a million books titles, then quick sort might be a better option.
                        <br> The important aspect here is to know the strenghts and weaknesses of the different algorithms!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Know you might be wondering.. If that is algorithm, then what is data structures..? <br> If you are, that is very nice, because I am about to tell you the difference between the two right now. <br><br> "DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DATA
                        STRUCTURE AND AN ALGORITHM: A data structure is the way you define a certain object <br> in a program language. ... An algorithm is a specific way of programming a task to make it work on the data you have".<br>
