INNER JOIN
Return all the articles for a user, returning the article title, text, published date and author name, 
but only for articles in 2018.

SELECT u.name AS author_name, a.title, a.text, a.publish_date
FROM  user u INNER JOIN
      article a ON u.id = a.author_user_id
WHERE a.publish_date >= '1/1/2018'
AND   a.publish_date <= '12/31/2018'

When would I use this?
To get information from 2 or more tables, and only when there is data in both tables (ignoring when there isn't).
