OUTER JOIN
Return all articles, even if they do not have authors (are anonymous), 
but if the author is known, provide that information

SELECT u.name AS author_name, a.title, a.text, a.publish_date
FROM  user u RIGHT OUTER JOIN
      article a ON u.id = a.author_user_id
      
When would I use this?
To get information from 2 or more tables, even when there may not be information in one of the tables that is related.
