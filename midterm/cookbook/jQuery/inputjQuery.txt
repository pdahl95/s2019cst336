Using <input> with jQuery

Add a form <input> element to the page that allows the user to enter in the 
URL of the "next" page to which the buttons and N key are bound.

ANSWER
<input id="url" name="url" value=""/>

and for the JavaScript, make a function to change the location, 
then call that wherever window.location.href = "next.html"; was found.

function goToNext() {
  var nextUrl = $('#url').val();
  window.location.href = nextUrl || "next.html";
}

* The || works to provide a default. Line 3 reads, "Set 
the window location reference to the location found in the variable nextUrl 
and if there is nothing in nextUrl use "next.html"."

When would I use this?
When I want to get a user to provide me information 
that I can either use in the page right then, or send to the server with an AJAX POST.
