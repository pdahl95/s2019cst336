$(document).ready(function(e) {

});


When would I use this?
When I need the elements to be there to do something, search for an element on the page. 
For example, any time I would use jQuery events I need the things that are responding to the event, e.g. a button, 
to be guaranteed to be on the page. If I want that guarantee, I make sure the code is inside document.onready event code.
