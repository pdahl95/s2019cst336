Create an Object in JavaScript
Make an object that stores a list of possible next pages, making sure to wrap the array in a simple object.

var nextData = {
    "pages" : []
}

When making a "valid JSON" object, use quotations around the property names

When would I use this?
When you want to store data you are pulling from somewhere or letting the user build up and make in your page.
