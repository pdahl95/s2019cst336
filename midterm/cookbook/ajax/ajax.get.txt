AJAX GET with jQuery

Use jQuery's .ajax() function to GET JSON data from the 
url "https://www.showdeolabs.com/data/csumb/jahenderson/kahoot-pretest.json", 
then display that data in the console if it is successful. 
Show an error message if the call is not successful.

// Make a global variable
var thingData;

$.ajax({
    type: "GET",
    url: "https://www.showdeolabs.com/data/csumb/jahenderson/kahoot-pretest.json",
    dataType: "json",
    success: function(data, status) {
      thingData = data;
      console.log("Got data", data);
    },
    error: function(err) {
      console.log("Didn't get data", err);
    }
 });
 
This should return data that looks like this:

{
  "things": []
}

Of particular note is the thingData variable. 
This is a global variable, which means that all my JavaScript can see it, 
and which also means that I have to be careful not to name something else the same thing. 
This will be useful in the next question, where I want to use thingData.

When would I use this?
When I want to get data from the server to show the user. 
I would make a global variable like thingData when I want every line of JavaScript to see it.

Note: Global variables can be seen by ALL JavaScript below the declaration, so be careful in your naming.
